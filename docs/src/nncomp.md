# Neural Network-Based Aeromagnetic Compensation Models

Shown below are diagrams for each of the neural network-based aeromagnetic compensation models.

## Model 2

![`:m2a` = NN determines Tolles-Lawson coefficients](assets/m2a.png)

![`:m2b` = NN determines additive correction to classical Tolles-Lawson](assets/m2b.png)

![`:m2c` = NN determines additive correction to classical Tolles-Lawson, Tolles-Lawson coefficients tuned as well](assets/m2c.png)

![`:m2d` = NN determines additive correction to each Tolles-Lawson coefficient](assets/m2d.png)

## Model 3

![`:m3` = NN determines additive correction to the expanded vector form of Tolles-Lawson](assets/m3.png)
