A basic set of starter Julia code files have been provided within the `src` folder. This code is largely based on work done by [Major Canciani](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1017870.pdf). A sample run file is located in the `runs` folder, which includes downloading the flight data via artifact. The flight data can also be directly downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dl/x37yr72x5a5nbz0/AADBt8ioU4Lm7JgEMQvPD7gxa/flight_data.tar.gz).
